# CLDI
The Corpus of Language Discrimination in Interaction 

This repository contains a working collection of transcripts in the [CHAT-CA Heritage format](https://talkbank.org/manuals/CHAT.html#_Toc40195923) - using the [CLAN transcript editing system](https://dali.talkbank.org/clan/).

It will be published along with full instructions for research users on [TalkBank's CABank website](https://ca.talkbank.org/). 

## Media files

In each transcript file, you will find links to the original media files on which they are based. A full collection of the (downloaded, clipped) videos that are precisely time-aligned with these transcripts will be made available soon.

## How to help

If you use these transcripts and would like to contribute to the project, please make sure to send any errors or transcription enhancements to [Saul Albert](http://saulalbert.net).

Please send any suggestions for new instances of language discrimination online that we could add to the corpus to [Chase Raymond](http://www.chasewesleyraymond.com/).

If you would be willing to help transpose these transcripts into other digital transcript formats (ELAN/strict CHAT), please also get in touch.
